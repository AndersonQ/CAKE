<B>Aim</b>

Make a delicious cake
<br/><br/>

<B>Rules</b>

+ Anyone can edit the recipie
+ You can change any aspect of it including igredients
+ The cake must still be technically a cake (no turning the recipi in to steak and chips)
+ It must be edible (non-toxic)
+ Must be affordable (as determined by how much spare change I have)
<br/><br/>

<B>End Point</b>

Some time next wednesday (26th March) I'll bake whatever recipie is currently on here.
